When I was a young and naïve high school graduate, I enrolled in art school, eventually getting my dual BA in Advertising Art (my school’s version of commercial art)/Art History. I believed then that following one’s passion was enough fulfillment, that everything would work out and what mattered most of all was that I loved what I did. Unfortunately, my graduation timing couldn’t have been more unfortunate – a few months into the recession of the early 2010’s. Most creative companies were on a hiring freeze while others were closing shop all together.  I found myself in a hyper-saturated industry with no leads and the ticking timebomb that was my student debt.  I rode out the wave for a few year, taking odd jobs and trying to slowly build a foundation to a career but the monthly student loan payments became far too much to handle and there were times where I honestly wasn’t sure where I was getting my next meal.
I had to admit defeat and move back home. With my family’s support I was able to get back on my feet and I started a career in the financial industry, slowly working my way up the cooperate ladder – selling pieces of my own pride for a buck or two more on a paycheck. 
I wasn’t happy but I wasn’t starving – that counted for something right?
Years into my career, however, I found myself wanting more. I realized that though I was making enough money to survive, I really wasn’t living.  I could go through my day at the office and not once have to think, each task providing no challenge and thus no reward. 
I knew that if I wanted true fulfillment, I would need a career that challenged me in every way yet provided enough income to allow me to take care of myself and those I love. I made an inventory of my skillset, cross referenced that with my passions and realized that coding could be the perfect cross section. 


Plus, when the robot wars begin, I feel like knowing some code might allow me to prove myself useful to our AI overlord.  Ha.
