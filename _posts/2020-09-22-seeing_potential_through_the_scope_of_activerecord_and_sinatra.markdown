Mod 2 was a challenge for me on many levels and yet I found myself thoroughly satisfied through most of my journey. Working with SQL was a familiar pain - using it sparingly in my current employment, but I was able to see first hand the true power it held when applied through ActiveRecord and Sinatra. 


For my final project I wanted to focus on something both usable and realistic for my life. I am an avid weightlifter, working out 4-5 days a week (though lately, it has been difficult to balance a full time job, Flatiron and my gym routine. Given the need for sleep I’ve had to cut back on my gym hours) so naturally fell into thinking of an app that would come in handy while lifting. My first thought was a calorie tracker as I often struggle meeting my macro needs but decided finally on a lifting tracker, something used to keep a journal of my lifts. 

I first began in the planning stage by either researching current apps in the market or remembering my use of similar apps in the past, being conscious of features I liked and things I did not - while keeping in mind that many features and styles would be beyond the scope of the project timeframe. The main takeaway from my market research was that so many apps had too many features, such as social media tools, report running, goal setting, etc, that made the whole process less than streamlined. Who really wants to click through 5 screens just to record a lift while in between exercises? Not me. 

I took to my user story with this in mind - aiming for simple yet effective. Once mapping out my CRUD features, I realized much to my delight, that ActiveRecord and Sinatra would  quite readily lend itself to what I envisioned. 

Once I started mapping my routes in my controller I really began to see just how powerful Sinatra could be. What impressed me the most was the idea of restful routes - how establishing a convention to URL naming can be functional on both an aesthetic and utilitarian level. I am 32 yrs old so I can remember the days before this became the norm and recalled the long, nonsensical URLs that created a labyrinth of a sitemap. How awful it must've been to keep track of all that mess on the server side, I can only imagine. I also gained a new appreciation for cookies and user data in relation to sessions. Making dynamic routes, even on this small of a scope, seems brilliant and magical yet completely logical and practical in execution. 

I look forward to revisiting this web app when I finish this course or perhaps have the rare weekend that has free time in order to study HTML stylings thoroughly and make something a little more pleasing for the eyes. Being someone from a design background, it was difficult for me to not go down that rabbit hole and possibly sabotage myself by spending more time than I had on aesthetics over proving my knowledge of function. 

Overall I am quite happy with the result, a skeletal structure of something that could prove very useful in my life. It’s so easy to get stuck in imposter syndrome while in this course, we work on so many things on a small scale that when I see myself creating something that can actually have practical use I am overwhelmed with pride and excited for what the other modules will bring.
